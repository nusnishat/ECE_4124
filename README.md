1.Write a MATLAB code of right sided signal<br>
2.Write a MATLAB code of left sided signal<br>
3.Write a MATLAB code of non-causal signal<br>

**Theory:** A signal x[n] is right-sided if there exists an integer N1 such that x[n] = 0 only for N1 ≤ n.It has all positive values. The signal x[n] is left-sided if there exists an integer N2 such that x[n] = 0 only for n ≤ N2.All the values of this signal are negative.<br>
A signal which is not causal is called the non-causal signal. Hence, by the definition, a signal that exists for positive as well as negative time is neither causal nor anti-causal, it is non-causal signal. The sine and cosine signals are examples of non-causal signal.<br>
The Z-transform converts a discrete-time signal, which is a sequence of real or complex numbers, into a complex frequency-domain (z-domain or z-plane) representation.<br>
The bilateral (two sided) z-transform of a discrete time signal x(n) is given as<Br>
Z.T[x(n)]=X(Z)=Σ∞n=−∞x(n)z−n<br>
  
**Discussion**: In this lab we have done z transformation of three different types of signal.In the first code we have done z tranform of right sided signal.In the second code we have done z transform of left sided signal and in third code, z transform of non-causal signal.<br>
  
**Conclusion**:As the codes are done successfully, we got the exactly same result in code as compared to the theory.
